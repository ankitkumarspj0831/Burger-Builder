This was a 4 week long project. Project goals included using technologies learned 
up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, and a significan
amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to 
minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weidrd technological 
rabbit holes.
